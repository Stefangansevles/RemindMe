//RemindMe has been rewritten from the ground up because the code wasn't neccesarely messy, but i really wasn't happy with the way it was coded.

(14-4-2017) V1.0.0 -  First release of the completely rewritten RemindMe.
(14-4-2017) V1.0.1 -  Reminders will now be sorted in the listview. Earliest date will be the first in the list
(15-4-2017) V1.0.2 -  Newly made reminders are placed correctly in the listview depending on their date, rather than always at the end.
(15-4-2017) V.1.0.3 - Fixed some first use issues when trying to read files that don't exist
(21-5-2017)V.1.1.0 -  New feature: You can now make reminders repeat every x days. i.e. every 3 days
(21-5-2017)V1.1.01 -  Increased the limit on repeating reminders every x days from 100 to 1000
(23-5-2017)V1.1.2  -  Fixed an issue where duplicate objects were made and shown in the listview / The create form will now be filled when you press edit on an reminder with an repeat type of every x days
(24-5-2017)V1.1.21 -  Unhandled exceptions will now not show the default windows popup, but our custom ErrorPopup instead. It will also write the error to the errorlog.
(24-5-2017)V1.1.22 -  Polished up the custom error form. It wil now use an untargetable-readonly textbox to display the text. The error form now has its own icon
(24-5-2017)V1.1.23 -  RemindMe now has a new icon
(25-5-2017)V1.1.24 -  Sound icon in the settings has been changed. When the user loads the settings, the music tab will load by default
(26-5-2017)V1.1.3 -   RemindMe now has a custom version of the default MessageBox. used by calling RemindMeBox.Show()
				      You can now change the name of an existing reminder. Previously it would create a new reminder
(27-5-2017)V1.2  -    RemindMe has been rewritten to now use SQLite to store reminders and settings. 
(5-6-2017)V1.3.0 - 
-previously, when a reminder is set to less than today, it will show the date of the reminder(in the past), but when it's today, it will show the time.
It now shows time when it is less than today aswell.

-Reminders can now be postponed.

-The reminder listview will now be updated after you close the reminder popup form. This is because reminders will now be updated after you close to popup

-Fixed a bug where the date of an newly made (weekly)reminder would be an week in the future even if the selected time is larger than the current time
i.e. an user creates a reminder every thursday at 11:00am(selected), and at the time of creation it is thursday, 10:50 pm(current).
The first reminder should then be in 10 minutes, not in a week and 10 minutes

(6-6-2017)V1.3.1 - Fixed a small bug where non-repeating reminders were deleted instantly,
so they couldn't be postponed. They are now temporarily set to disabled like the other reminders

(7-6-2017)V1.3.2 
-If you postponed a reminder, it will now show the date of the postponedate in the listview, and will show its date with an (p) which means postponed
-Updated the create if not exists SQLite table query

(10-6-2017)V1.4.0
-Reminders can now be repeated at custom. 
custom: every x minutes,hours,days,weeks, or months. i.e. every 4 hours, or every 2 weeks

(10-6-2017)V1.4.1
Fixed a small problem where the date timepicker would not update when you change the time. 
If it's 2:00 am, and you select the reminder time to be 1:00am and on the same weekly/monthly date as today, it should not set it to today, but to the next week/month instead

(11-6-2017)V1.4.11
Reminders will now be read from the database once on start, and everytime the database changes.
Every tick of the timer a local cached reminder list will be read, instead of connecting with the database every tick of the timer, which is now the case because the database is local(SQLite), because of this it doesn't matter that much, but it's good practise.
