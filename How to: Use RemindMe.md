# How do i use this program?

# NOTE!

The color scheme used in this example was Dark-red, but you can select a different one, or make your own! If you don't like these colors, feel free to change them!

When you launch RemindMe for the first time, you will see an empty list

# How will it look when it pops up?
When an reminder pops up, it will always be on top. This is very effective because you will always notice it.

If you want to be reminded of the same reminder a little bit later, click the postpone checkbox, fill in an amount and select minutes, or hours. Then simply press the button

However, if you don't want it to interrupt whatever it is you're doing, you can go to window overlay.

There you can select it to be minimized. It will make a sound if you added it to the reminder, but it will only show up in the taskbar. You won't see it until you click it



If you want to see what the reminder would look like when it pops up, you can preview it by right clicking it like shown here

# Did you know? | Timers

RemindMe has a Timer system. You can access timer from the `Timer` tab

BUT, if you go into settings and enable the quick timer hotkey (and set a combination)

![](https://i.imgur.com/TOvkdrn.png)

you can press the combination **anywhere!**, while gaming, watching a movie, anytime! For example, here I am playing a game, and decided to quickly set a timer

Also, if you want to quickly see how much time there is left on running timers, you can press the other key combination that you set in the settings. You can also press the "-" or "+" to add or subtract one minute quickly.

# Did you know? | Advanced Reminders

RemindMe can be configured to use Advanced Reminders. Advanced Reminders can execute batch code when the reminder pops up. You can do a lot of things with that, but I'll leave that up to you ;)

To create an "Advanced Reminder", first select the option in the "settings" tab:

Like the message suggests, you now have a new button when creating reminders:

Press it, and you will be able to:

1) Add batch code

2) Hide the reminder so that it doesn't pop up visibly. This turns the reminder into a batch script that runs every x ... or however you configured it.

I've pasted some example batch code to demonstrate it.

The reminder will now also have a different icon to indicate that it is an Advanced Reminder with batch code enabled. When you hover over the icon you will be able to quickly see the batch code:

To demonstrate how it looks when it pops up, I've made a .gif
